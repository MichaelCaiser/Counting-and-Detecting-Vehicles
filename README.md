# Counting-and-Detecting-Vehicles
It's a program written in C++ for counting and detecting vehicles. This program use the opencv library (version 2.4.10) for the image processing. This is a project of the SIPLab (Laboratory of Signal and Image Processing) at Tecnologico de Costa Rica (TEC). The main idea is to create a multi-platform library for counting and detection vehicles with the use of computer vision.
